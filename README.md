# CS4750-Mobile-App
Final project for my CS 4750 Mobile App Development class.

## Description
This application allows the user to make a custom list of movies and view the best subscription services for needs. The application gets its data from The Movie Database's API which has no rate limits (as of December 2019).

## Notes
A movie's available providers and subscription services are only viewable when viewed from your customized list. They are not viewable from the search page. This design choice was made to prevent massive loading times since the API forces me to load the provider information at the same time as the rest of the movie's data.

## Future Updates
I eventually want to add TV show functionality to the application. My basic design plan for this is to add different tabs at the top of the home page which allows you to alternate between your lists of TV shows and movies.
